### Active DPS

Total Damage / Active Time (see below)

### Active Time

"Active" time is the cumulative time in which tracked casts are doing damage, including cast time. For DoTs and MF, the active time is the delta
between start of cast and the last damage tick. For direct damage spells with a cast time (e.g. Mind Blast), the cast time is used. For instant casts,
GCD is used.

### Avg DoT Downtime

If the player casts the same DoT (SW:P, VT) on a target multiple times per encounter, the downtime for each cast is the delta between the start
of the current cast and the last tick of the previous cast:

```
current.dotDowntime = current.castEnd - previous.lastDamageTimestamp
```

The Avg per-cast downtime is the mean of the downtime for all included casts. Casts with downtime greater than 10s are ignored for the average 
as outliers likely to represent time moving for mechanics, phase transitions, etc.

### Avg Off Cooldown

For spells with cooldowns (MB, SW:D), the time off cooldown for a given cast is the delta between the end of the previous cast and the start of
the current cast, minus the cooldown of the spell:

```
cast.timeOffCooldown = current.castStart - previous.castEnd - spell.cooldown
```

The Avg Time Off Cooldown is the mean of the downtime for all included casts. Casts with downtime greater than 10s are ignored for the
average as outliers likely to represent time moving for mechanics, phase transitions, etc.

### Avg MF Latency

The "post-channel latency" on a Mind Flay cast is the delta between the last damage tick of the channel (or the start of the channel, if
no damage) and the start of the next cast:

```
endOfCurrent = current.lastDamageTimestamp OR current.castEnd
current.nextCastLatency = next.castStart - endOfCurrent
```

The Avg latency is the mean of the latency for each included cast. Casts with latency greater than 3s are ignored, since they likely
represent movement rather than casting latency. Casts which were [clipped early](#early-mf-clips) are also excluded, since they are reported
separately. Thus the "avg latency" represents something like how efficiently you cast after a mind flay under "normal" circumstances without
mistakes. For stats on how frequently you mis-clip mind flay, see [Early MF Clips](#early-mf-clips) instead.

See [Basics](BASICS.md) for more on the mechanics of mind flay clipping.

### Avg Spellpower

Cast data from WCL includes the spellpower of the caster at the time of the cast, which is displayed for each cast. Instead of a simple mean,
the Avg Spellpower calculation is weighted by the amount of damage done by the cast, in order to represent the idea that it's more beneficial
to have greater spellpower (e.g. from trinkets) for casts that do more damage, like DoTs.

```
stats.avgSpellpower = sum(cast.spellPower * cast.totalDamage) / sum(cast.totalDamage)
```

### Clipped Dots

If a DoT is active on a given target, and it is re-cast on that target again before the final tick of the previous DoT, then the current
cast has clipped the previous:

```
current.clippedPreviousCast = current.castStart < previous.expectedLastDamageTimestamp AND previous.ticks < expected
```

See [Basics](BASICS.md) for more about why clipping DoTs is undesirable.

### DPS/Power

DPS = [Active DPS](#active-dps)
Power = [Avg Spellpower](#avg-spellpower)

```
stats.powerMetric = DPS / Power
```

### Early MF Clips

In cases where a Mind Flay channel is clearly interrupted for a new spell very close to the next expected tick, the cast is flagged as 
"clipped early". Currently the threshold for flagging is if the clip occurs more than 75% of the way to the next expected tick of the channel, 
taking haste into account. The number displayed is the number of casts that were clipped early by this measure.

Haste is accounted for by using the time between ticks (or between the cast and first tick), therefore at least one MF ticks must
occur for the cast to be flagged. Also note that only channels interrupted *for a new spell cast* are flagged, since the new start of the new cast
is needed for recognizing the clip. Channel interruptions from movement are not flagged.

### Clipped MF DPS

Estimates DPS lost from [Early MF Clips](#early-mf-clips). This value is estimated by assuming that the clipped tick would have hit for the same
amount as the previous tick. DPS is calculated by adding this "missing" damage to the overall damage for the encounter, with a slight discount,
depending on how closely you clipped before the next tick. The closer the clip, the "freer" that damage would have been. In other words, 
the discount factor tries to estimate for the fact that clipping early means starting the next cast sooner, so there is *some* small opportunity 
cost to waiting for the next tick.

The discount factor is the ratio between the time that has passed since the last tick (or cast start), and the time the next tick would have landed.
So if you clip 0.95s after the last tick, which would have landed at 1.0s, the discount is `0.95/1.0` = `0.95`.

```
stats.lostMfDps = (channelStats.totalClippedDamage * discountFactor) / encounter.durationSeconds
```

### Truncated

If a DoT or Mind Flay is cut off early because the mob died, then the cast is marked as truncated. DoTs truncated with less than
half of the expected ticks are flagged, as are Mind Flay casts with no ticks because the target died.
